# Cost benchmarks

What the harness costs you, measured against Claude Code with no harness at all. The static figure
below exists today. The live replay that compares whole tasks is tracked separately and is not
published yet, so nothing here claims a saving.

## Static context figure

Every session the harness manages starts with its global instructions, rules, selected stances and
output style already in context, plus one listed description for each agent, skill and command. A
bare Claude Code session loads none of that, so the whole count is the harness's standing overhead.

```sh
python3 scripts/cost_bench.py static            # print the figure for this checkout
python3 scripts/cost_bench.py static --check    # what CI runs
python3 scripts/cost_bench.py static --write    # refresh benchmarks/static.json at a release
```

`benchmarks/static.json` is the committed figure for the last release. It records files, lines,
characters, an estimated token count for the default stance selection and for the longest variant
of every dimension, the five largest files, and what that many tokens cost per model.

- **Tokens are an estimate:** characters divided by four. It is there to show the trend between
  versions with no tokenizer, network call or API key. It is not a billing figure.
- **Dollars come from `policy/prices.json`.** `session_start` prices the layer as one cache write,
  `later_turn` as one cache read. A session that outlives the cache pays the write again.
- **CI fails when the estimate grows more than 5% over the committed figure.** Trim the growth, or
  add an entry to `benchmarks/allow.json` naming `harness_version`, the new `est_tokens` and a
  `reason`. The entry stops matching as soon as the figure moves again.
- **The line cap in `harness lint` is separate and unchanged.** The cap bounds the worst case in
  lines; this tracks the default selection in tokens and dollars, version by version.

## Limits

- Claude Code only. Codex instructions are rendered at sync time and are not counted.
- Your own `CLAUDE.personal.md`, memory files, MCP servers and hook output are not counted. They
  are yours, not the harness's, and MCP tool definitions alone can outweigh everything measured
  here.
- Full agent and skill bodies load only when used, so only their descriptions are counted.
